# Hubble_constant
Determining the Value for the Hubble constant from a sample of Supernovae light curves given by the Canergie supernova project 2011.
Starting from the available data(70 SNe .dat files), only for supernovae having data before the maximum, calculate:

• the time of the maximum,

• the apparent magnitude in b-band at the maximum,

• the b-band magnitude 15 days after the maximum.
From these data we then obtain:
• the absolute magnitude in band B, correcting for extinction,

• the module of distance μ,

• the distance (brightness) of the object.

Finally, use the distance-redshift relationship to estimate the constant of Hubble H0.
